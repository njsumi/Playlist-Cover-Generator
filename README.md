### Playlist Cover Generator

# Project Description
Color Palette is a website where users can get unique playlist cover images for their playlists. The website takes a Spotify playlist URL and extracts features such as the energy, time signature, tempo, and danceability of the songs in the playlist using Spotify's WebAPI. Using these features, an image generation prompt is created and sent to DALLE to create three unique images that match the musicality of the given playlist. The three images are then displayed to the user.
